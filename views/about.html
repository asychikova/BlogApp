        <p>As a student of Computer Programming at Seneca College, I have developed a passion for technology and its role in shaping our world. 
          <h2>Interests</h2>
          My interests lie in the fields of web development, software development, and data analysis, as these areas allow for a creative expression of technical skills.
          I am also interested in fashion and digital drawing. I try to keep up with trends in interface and visual presentation design. Although I am just starting out, I always aim to produce something interesting, visually pleasing, and memorable.
          I believe that technology has the power to transform lives, and this is what drives me to become a better developer. I am constantly seeking out new challenges and opportunities to improve my skills and work on projects. I believe that by combining 
          my technical expertise with my desire to make a difference, in a future I can create meaningful and impactful projects.
